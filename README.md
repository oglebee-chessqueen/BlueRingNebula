# BlueRingNebula
Repository of data and custom code used in the data analysis and modeling presented in Hoadley et al. (2020) [Nature] 

Observational data not available through publically accessible archives (e.g., Keck (KOA), NASA-based missions [GALEX, Spitzer, WISE, 2MASS] (MAST), SDSS, etc) is found in the "data" folder.

Source code integral to the results of the Hoadley et al. (2020) findings are found in the "sourcecode" folder. Most relevant is the MESA merger subroutine and inlist files, to replicate the temporal evolution of a primary star that is injected with the energy of a stellar merger.

For any other inquiries or data missing from either directory, please contact the author (Keri Hoadley - khoadley@caltech.edu)
